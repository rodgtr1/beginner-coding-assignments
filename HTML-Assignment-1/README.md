## Mock Scenario

Hello,

My name is Harry from Marshall Mill Studios, downtown, and I wanted to see if you could help me on a project.

We have a local client that is hosting a fairly large conference here in October. It's a 2-day conference for Budding Web Developers called "Advancing Technology." There will be 8 speakers, 24 workshops, and 800 attendees.

Currently our developer is out on sick leave and we need someone to fill in and were referred to you for the job.

So far, we have a rough outline for the site. No styling direction or branding yet, but we need to get the structure put together to be sure we get this site up in time.Â  So for now, it's straight HTML. Don't worry about any styling but let's get the elements of the site together at least by the end of the week.

There are only two pages, a homepage and a tickets page.

Here's the mockup. I'll be giving you more to add in the next day or two. I won't having any styling info until next week, so remember to just work on the structure for now.

Homepage Mockup, Tickets Page Mockup, and Images are found in the resources folder.

Thanks a bunch,

Harry

## About Assignment #1:

[Getting Started Video](https://youtu.be/FA5uFmrY2oA)

..and adding to the video:

1. Don't worry about breaking anything into sections, headers, footers or adding any classes or ids. Just focus on coding all the elements in a stack.
2. Don't copy and paste code. This exercise may seem repetitive, but it will give you some good practice in not only the HTML syntax, but in writing code in general. It's a worthy pursuit at this stage to type it all out.

## A new VS Code extension
Install the Highlight Matching Tag extension by vincaslt. This will show you the matching tag (closing or opening) and will help when your HTML files get large. 

## My Code Solution

Please don't check out my code in the "solution-dont-peek" folder until you make an extended effort to finish the whole assignment on your own. You will learn so much and grow faster as a coder by pressing through the assignments and completing them. But after you have made a solid effort and completed the assignment, take a glance at how I did it.
