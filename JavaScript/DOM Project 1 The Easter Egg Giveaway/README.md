## Project Instructions

Create your modal. I usually put this at the bottom of my page somewhere. It doesn't matter. Give it a class of modal-hidden.

In your stylesheet, create a modal-hidden class and a modal-shown class. The hidden class with be set to display none. The shown class will be set to display and will put the modal in the middle of the screen.

Target your elements (there are 4 of them)

When the "o" is clicked, the class for the easter egg should change to modal-shown. Otherwise it will be modal-hidden. 

When the 'X' is clicked, the modal will be hidden again.

Get this modal functionality down first, and then move on to the input.

Create your modal input not as a form, but to listen for keystrokes. If it matches the number, set the winner alert. If it doesn't, set the sorry alert. Remember, it can't provide a sorry alert until either the number matches or 5 keystrokes happen.

If they get the failed alert, have the input be erased when they click OK.

Please don't check the solution in the solutions-dont-peek folder until you've wrestled with the outcome and solved it. You will learn so much through this process. But after you have a working solution, feel free to compare.
