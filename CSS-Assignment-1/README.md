## Mock Scenario Continued

Hey,

We need to start adding some style to our new site.

I've met with the client and our designer, and we've created a color palette for branding and a mockup of the next progression of the site.

The fonts will be Roboto 700 for the headings and Open Sans 400 and 700 for the rest. You can get these simply from Google Fonts.

In the resources folder are the mockups as well as the color pallette for the site.

Thanks again,

Harry

## My Code Solution

Please don't check out my code in the "solution-dont-peek" folder until you make an extended effort to finish the whole assignment on your own. You will learn so much and grow faster as a coder by pressing through the assignments and completing them. But after you have made a solid effort and completed the assignment, take a glance at how I did it.
