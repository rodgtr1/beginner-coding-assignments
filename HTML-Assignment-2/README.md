## Mock Scenario Continued

Hey,

Harry again. The client wants to add a few more things to the site structure as well.

First, he wants a simple list near the top giving a few key benefits of the conference.

Second, a table on the homepage. The table will have two columns. One column will be the pricing and info for the Standard package and the second column will be the pricing and info for the Premium package. These are packages that attendees can choose when purchasing tickets.

Finally, there needs to be a form on the tickets page for them to register. This should have a Name and Email field, a dropdown to choose which package they want (standard or premium), and a few optional add-on checkboxes. Please make the Name and Email inputs required inputs.

I've added these to the mockups and included them in the resources folder for you to reference.

Thanks!

Harry

## My Code Solution

Please don't check out my code in the "solution-dont-peek" folder until you make an extended effort to finish the whole assignment on your own. You will learn so much and grow faster as a coder by pressing through the assignments and completing them. But after you have made a solid effort and completed the assignment, take a glance at how I did it.
