## Mock Scenario Continued

Hey,

The site is looking great!

Now we need to adapt it to tablet and mobile devices.

The designer gave me a mockup for mobile that I want to you use for reference. They did not supply me with a tablet mockup so use your best judgment. They also did not supply me with one for the tickets page, so again, use your skills to make it adapt.

Mockup is in the resources folder.

Thanks again!

## My Code Solution

Please don't check out my code in the "solution-dont-peek" folder until you make an extended effort to finish the whole assignment on your own. You will learn so much and grow faster as a coder by pressing through the assignments and completing them. But after you have made a solid effort and completed the assignment, take a glance at how I did it.
