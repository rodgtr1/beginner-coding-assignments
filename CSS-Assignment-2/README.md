## Mock Scenario Continued

Hey,

I had another meeting with the designer and we've added more changes to the website that we need you to implement.

Unfortunately he was amped up and talking fast, so all I have are these scribbled notes I took. Thankfully, he provided me with an updated mockup as well (available below).

<ul>
 	<li>Body - change font size to 18px;</li>
 	<li>Paragraphs - change line height to 1.4</li>
 	<li>Header - make image smaller; round image; border</li>
 	<li>3 Points Section - round images; add swirl.png background (download file below); make images have borders on hover;</li>
 	<li>Table - table headers and cells with borders; text-centered; make links buttons and remove that hideous underline of links</li>
 	<li>Speakers - round images; add swirl.png background, add border to columns and slight box shadow</li>
 	<li>Form - hide labels and use placeholders instead; "Package" is in the wrong place; make inputs bigger and style button; remove "back to home" link completely</li>
</ul>
<br>

You'll find the mockups, background pattern, and palette in the resources folder.

Thanks again!

## My Code Solution

Please don't check out my code in the "solution-dont-peek" folder until you make an extended effort to finish the whole assignment on your own. You will learn so much and grow faster as a coder by pressing through the assignments and completing them. But after you have made a solid effort and completed the assignment, take a glance at how I did it.
