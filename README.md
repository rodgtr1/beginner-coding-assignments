# Project

This project involves building a website for a large developer's conference called "Advancing Technology." 

You'll be given a number of requests from a mock agency to demonstrate your web dev skills by building out this website from scratch. Each assignment will build on each other. 

The order of assignments include:

1. HTML Assignment 1
2. HTML Assignment 2
3. HTML Assignment 3
4. CSS Assignment 1
5. CSS Assignment 2
6. CSS Assignment 3
7. Github
8. JavaScript DOM Project 1
9. JavaScript DOM Project 2
10. JavaScript DOM Project 3

The README in each assignment will provide instructions including a link to a "Getting Started" video, written instructions, resources, and my own solution, though only use that if stuck of completely finished.

The level of exercise progresses as the assignment number goes up. So HTML Assignment 1 could be done after learning a little HTML while HTML Assignment 3 should be done near the end of the HTML material. Same for CSS and JS.
