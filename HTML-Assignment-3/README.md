## Mock Scenario Continued

Hi,

Great job so far.

But I have one last request in regards to structure.

Can you go through the two pages and add the proper HTML5 semantics so we can be sure that search engines can sort this all out optimally?

So each section should have an open and close <section></section> tags.

Also we need to add <header> and <footer> sections.

Finally, we should add a simple navigation for the two pages at the top, and this wrapped in <nav> elements. These can just be an unordered list for now, we'll style it next week.

And that's all!

Thanks again for working on this. The mockups of the above changes are in the resources folder. You won't see a lot on the front end with these elements added, but do note the new navigation.

I'll get back to you once the client reviews the work.

Regards,

Harry

## My Code Solution

Please don't check out my code in the "solution-dont-peek" folder until you make an extended effort to finish the whole assignment on your own. You will learn so much and grow faster as a coder by pressing through the assignments and completing them. But after you have made a solid effort and completed the assignment, take a glance at how I did it.
